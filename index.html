    <h2>Tim's Routine</h2>
    <p>Tim is a bit of a sleepy head. He averages around 21 hours, even longer then his peers. 
        It is assumed that he dreams of fresh green leafs and avocados. While sleeping he digests 
        leafs which give him only marginal more energy then he consumes for the digestion itself. 
        Only a short few hours during the night he nibbles on leafs of his tree before dreaming of
        greener leafs again.</p>
